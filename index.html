	<h3> Research for plan of action:</h3>
	<ul>
		-problems include antomical complexity of spine
		-MRI is often able to capture good quality images of soft tissue, but bone are sometimes captured with intensity similar to air 
		-Images contain noise
			-Approach to resolve this: we can reduce the size of the image (decrease number of pixels) and filter the image using method proposed in paper proposed by Nobi and Yousuf (2011)
			-Decided to impletement Guassian method as this is exists in Simple ITK
	</ul>
