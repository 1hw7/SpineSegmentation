	<h1> Welcome Hannah & Hannah's Spine Segmentation Page </h1>
	<a href="https://github.com/1hw7/SpineSegmentation"> Git Repository</a>

	<h2> Spine Segementation approach plan coming Friday Feb 10th </h2>
	<h3> Some helpful links:</h3>
	<ul>

		<li>Input data from OneDrive link: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhiABcbe1DBygctwlJ-jZco3vlrOEQ </li>

	</ul>
	<h3> Problems faced:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>problems include antomical complexity of spine
		<li>MRI is often able to capture good quality images of soft tissue, but bone are sometimes captured with intensity similar to air 
		<li>Images contain noise
	</ul>
	<h3> Plan of action: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> we can reduce the size of the image (decrease number of pixels) and filter the image using method proposed in paper proposed by Nobi and Yousuf (2011)
		<li> Decided to impletement Guassian Filter as this is exists in Simple ITK
	</ul>
