	<h3> Problems faced:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>problems include antomical complexity of spine
		<li>MRI is often able to capture good quality images of soft tissue, but bone are sometimes captured with intensity similar to air 
		<li>Images contain noise
	</ul>
	<h3> Plan of action: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> we can reduce the size of the image (decrease number of pixels) and filter the image using method proposed in paper proposed by Nobi and Yousuf (2011)
		<li> Decided to impletement Guassian Filter as this is exists in Simple ITK
		<li> Began research on how method would be tested. This data set containing 10 images could be used to evaluate efficacy of an algorithm

		<li>GT (graph theory? will ask Tamas in class tomorrow) based methods commonly used in vertebrae segmentation
		<li> Hannah and I were both interested in an approach which in which a directed graph is constructed for a target structure, then attempt to search for the boundary of the target structure from the constructed graph by applying a graph theory-based optimal boundary search process

		<li> Successful detection rate with various ranges of accuracy: If the absolute difference between the localized VB center and the ground truth center is no greater than t mm, the localization of this VB is considered as a successful detection; otherwise, it is considered as a false localization. The equation of the successful localization rate Pt with accuracy of less than t mm can be formulated as follows: # of accurate VB localizations/total #VBs
